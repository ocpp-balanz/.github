# balanz - Simple OCPP CS or LC with Smart Charging Capabilities

balanz is an OpenSource initiative focused on providing smart charging capabilities to enterprises with own charger deployments.

balanz may be deployed either as an OCPP Local Controller (LC) taking care of Smart Charging functions while delegating remaining
functions to a Central System (CS), or as a simplistic full CS. balanz supports OCPP version 1.6J.

Apart from the main backend part, balanz, additional repositories will host a simple OCPP simulator, ocppsim, a UI, etc.

balanz is developed and maintained by Jens Vedel Markussen, jens.markussen@gmail.com.
